## Problem Statement
High-beam glare from oncoming vehicles can cause temporary blindness, increasing the risk of accidents. Current solutions rely on expensive sensors or manual adjustments, which are inefficient and costly. The **Vision Guard System** aims to solve this issue through an AI-driven, camera-based approach.

## Methodology
1. **Video Frame Capture**: The camera continuously records video frames of the road ahead.
2. **Flash Detection**: Image processing techniques isolate high-intensity areas and detect glare patterns.
3. **Glare Analysis**: Machine learning algorithms determine whether the detected pattern indicates glare discomfort.
4. **Headlight Adjustment**: If glare is detected, the system triggers a dimming mechanism using Arduino-controlled LED headlights.
5. **Adaptive Learning**: The system improves over time through reinforcement learning models.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Camera Module**: High-resolution camera optimized for low-light conditions.
- **Arduino Microcontroller**: Controls the headlight dimming mechanism.
